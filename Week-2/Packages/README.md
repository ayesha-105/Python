# Packages in Python
- A package is a folder that contains multiple Python modules grouped together to organize larger projects.
- A package must include an empty __init__.py file.
- Packages help structure code when a project grows big and needs multiple modules.
- You can import modules from a package using dot notation (e.g., import mypackage.module1).
- Packages allow better organization, reusability, and clean project management.
